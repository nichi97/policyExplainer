## Who I am
I am Chi Gao, a graduate student currently studying at the School of Global Policy and Strategy at UC San Diego. My main focus of study is Chinese economy. Broadly speaking, I am interested in understanding the power of technology and how it transforms society. With a degree in Math and Computer Science, I deeply believe that we are conferred with a set of tools that enable us to study the complex social interactions from a new perspective.

## The purpose of this website

The main motivation comes from two sources. The first is this [manga](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%A0%E6%B2%BB%E9%9A%86%E4%BB%8B%E3%81%AE%E8%AD%B0). This manga presents a dilemma: Should politician practice realpolitik, which is often characterized by secrecy and manipulation of public opinion, or take on the responsibility to communicate public policy with frankness and rationality?
